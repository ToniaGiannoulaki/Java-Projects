Zoo Management Application

This is a Java application for managing a zoo's animal catalog. The program allows users to view, add, search, edit, and delete animals from the zoo's records. Instead of using a database like SQLite, the project utilizes Java Serialization to save data in files, ensuring that all changes are persisted between sessions.
Features

    View all animals in the zoo
    Add new animals to the catalog
    Search for animals by name or ID
    Edit animal details by ID
